//TODO
//Here I should have written a test, which would check whether all pictures from bright and too_dark are classified correctly.
//Preferably no pictures would be renamed/moved during this process.
//This can be done using akka.testkit (at least I think so, I have never actually used it) by chcecking whether ClassfierActor
//send back what it should send, or by mocking ResultHandler
